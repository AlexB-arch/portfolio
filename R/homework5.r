#If one letter is chosen at random from the English alphabet, find the probability that the letter
#(a) is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
#(b) comes before the letter h.
#(c) is a vowel or is contained in the word statistics.

# Solution
# (a) The probability of choosing a vowel is 5/26.
# (b) The probability of choosing a letter before h is 7/26.
# (c) The probability of choosing a vowel or a letter in the word statistics is 5/26 + 4/26 = 9/26.

#A pair of dice is rolled three times. What is the probability that a sum of 7 or 11 is rolled at least
#once?

# Solution
# The probability of rolling a sum of 7 or 11 is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

#In a high school graduating class of 100 students, 60 studied mathematics, 65 studied history,
#and 40 studied both mathematics and history. If one of these students is selected at random,
#find the probability that
#(a) the student takes mathematics or history.
#(b) the student does not take either one of these subjects.
#(c) the student takes history but not mathematics.

# Solution
# (a) The probability of taking mathematics or history is 125/100 = 5/4.
# (b) The probability of not taking either one of these subjects is 5/100.
# (c) The probability of taking history but not mathematics is 65/100 - 40/100 = 25/100.

#A class in advanced physics is comprised of 12 juniors, 24 seniors and 6 graduate students. The
#final grades showed that 3 of the juniors, 9 of the seniors and 3 of the graduate students
#received an A for the course. If a student is chosen at random from this class and is found to
#have received an A, what is the probability that he or she is a senior?

# Solution
# The probability of being a senior is 24/42 = 2/7. The probability of being a senior and receiving an A is 9/42.

#A hardware manufacturer produces nuts and bolts. Each bolt produced is attached to a nut to
#make a single unit. It is known that 2% of the nuts produced and 3% of the bolts produced are
#defective in some way. A nut-bolt unit is considered defective if either the nut or the bolt has a
#defect.
#(a) Determine the percentage of defective nut-bolt units
#(b) What assumptions are you making in solving part (a)?

# Solution
# (a) The probability of a nut being defective is 0.02. The probability of a bolt being defective is 0.03.
# The probability of a nut-bolt unit being defective is 0.02 + 0.03 - 0.02*0.03 = 0.029.
# (b) The assumption is that the nuts and bolts are independent.

#A experiment was conducted with 98 test subjects regarding polygraph instruments. The
#results of the experiment are in the following table:
#                       Did the Subject Lie?
#                       No Yes
#Positive Test Result 15 42
#Negative Test Result 32 9
#(a) If 1 of the 98 test subjects is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject had a
#positive test result given that the subject actually lied.
#(b) If 1 of the 98 test subjects is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject actually
#lied given that he or she had a positive test result.

# Solution
# (a) The probability of a positive test result given that the subject lied is 42/98.
# (b) The probability of the subject lying given that he or she had a positive test result is 42/54 = 7/9.


#7. A person guesses the answers to three multiple choice questions at random. If there are five
#possible choices on each question, what is the probability that
#(a) all three are answered correctly?
#(b) at least two questions are answered correctly?
#(c) all three questions are answered correctly given that at least one question is answered
#correctly?

# Solution
# (a) The probability of answering all three questions correctly is 1/5 * 1/5 * 1/5 = 1/125.
# (b) The probability of answering at least two questions correctly is 1 - (4/5)^3 = 1 - 0.512 = 0.488.
# (c) The probability of answering all three questions correctly given that at least one question is
# answered correctly is 1/5 * 1/5 * 1/5 / (1 - (4/5)^3) = 1/125 / 0.488 = 1/61.

#8. Two events ùê¥ and ùêµ are mutually exclusive. Are these events independent, dependent, or is
#there not enough information to say? Explain your answer.

# Solution
# The events are independent. If ùê¥ occurs, then ùêµ cannot occur. If ùêµ occurs, then ùê¥ cannot occur.
