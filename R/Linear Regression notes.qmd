## Linear Regression

```{r}
#predict(fit, new, interval="prediction")
```

How good is the regression equation at predicting?

Linear Regression Model

$$ 
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$

Constant Model

$$
y(x)=y
$$

ANOVA comes into play at some point.

Proportionate Reduction in Error:

$$
SS(Total) - SS(Error)/ SS Total
$$

The PRE is closely related to the correlation coefficient.

Be able to use the linear regression summary

$r^2=R^2$ = coefficient of determination.

Beware of negative slopes.

Final:

-   interpret R output. No R commands.

-   Critical values may be given as multiple choice based on the tail of the test.
