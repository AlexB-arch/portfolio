#1. Suppose a set 𝐴 has exactly 3003 subsets with 6 elements. What is the cardinality of 𝐴.


#2. How many 16-digit binary strings contain exactly six 1s. (Examples of such strings include
#0110000111010000 and 0000110101011000.)

#3. Calculate: 𝑋 ∈2{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} : |𝑋| <4

#4. This problem concerns lists of length 6 made from the letters A, B, C, D, E, F without
#repetition. How many such lists have the property that D comes before the A.

#5. How many positive 10-digit integers contain no 0s and exactly three 6s?

#6. Use the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of 𝑝8 in (2𝑝 −5)13.

#7. Twenty people attend a party. If everyone shakes everyone else’s hand exactly once, how
#many handshakes take place?

#8. There are variety of special hands that one can be dealt in poker. For each of the following
#types of hands, count the number of hands that have that type.
#(a) Flush. The hand contains five cards all of the same suit.
#(b) Straight. The five cards have consecutive numerical values, such as 7-8-9-10-jack. Treat
#the ace as being higher than the king but not less than the 2. The suits are irrelevant.
#(c) Straight Flush. The hand is both a straight and a flush.
#(d) Two Pair. The hand contains two different pairs and an unmatched fifth card.


# Solutions
#1. 2^6 = 64
#2. 2^16 = 65536
#3. 2^4 = 16
#4. 5! = 120
#5. 10!/(6!*4!) = 151200
#6. 13C8 = 1287
#7. 20C2 = 190
#8. (a) 4^5 = 1024
#(b) 10C5 * 4^5 = 2598960
#(c) 10C5 * 4^5 = 2598960
#(d) 10C2 * 9C2 * 8C2 * 7C2 * 6C2 = 2598960

# Cardinality of a set
# A set is a collection of objects. The cardinality of a set is the number of objects in the set.
# The cardinality of a set is denoted by |𝐴|.
# The cardinality of a set 𝐴 is the number of elements in 𝐴.

# (n)k = n!/(n-k)!
