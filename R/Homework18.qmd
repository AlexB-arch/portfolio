1.  Scatter plot from 11.3

    ```{r}
    data = read.delim("ex11-3.txt", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
    xValues = data$X.x.
    yValues = data$X.y.

    plot(xValues, yValues, 
         main = "Scatter Plot with Least Squares Regression Line", 
         xlab = "X Values",
         ylab = "Y Values",
         pch = 19, col = "blue")

    model = lm(yValues ~ xValues)

    abline(model, col = "red", lwd = 2)

    summary(model)


    ```

2.  Exercise 11.22

    ```{r}
    values = read.delim("ex11-22.txt", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
    treadmillTime = values$X.Treadmill.
    raceTime  = values$X.10.K.

    # a
    plot(treadmillTime, raceTime, 
         main = "Scatter Plot of Treadmill Time vs Race Time", 
         xlab = "Treadmill Time (minutes)", 
         ylab = "Race Time (minutes)", 
         pch = 19, col = "blue")

    # b
    model = lm(raceTime ~ treadmillTime)
    abline(model, col = "red", lwd = 2)

    # c
    summary(model)

    b0 = coef(model)[1]  # Intercept
    b1 = coef(model)[2]  # Slope

    ```

    b\. Multiple R-squared shows that it's a good model.

    c\. The estimated regression model is: Å· = 58.8158  + -1.8673x
