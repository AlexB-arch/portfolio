# 1.

Test Used: Two-tailed Z-test

$$
H_0:\mu = 500
$$

$$
H_a: \mu \neq 500
$$

Test statistic: z = 1.885618

Critical Value: 2.575829

Rejection Region: (z \< -2.575829, z \> 2.575829)

p-value: 0.5865993

Decision: Fail to reject H0 because it is within the rejection region and p value is greater than alpha.

Conclusion: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the sample mean is different than 500.

## a.

Test statistic: 1.885618

Critical Value: 2.575829

Not enough evidence to reject because z is not greater than 2.5758.

## b.

Probability of Type II Error: 0.5866

## c.

| mu  | Power      |
|-----|------------|
| 450 | 0.98375039 |

## d.

Probability of Type II Error: 0.224374

## e.

Required Sample Size to achieve Beta \<= 0.04: 169

# 2.

Test Used: Right tail Z-test

$$
H_0:\mu = 41
$$

$$
H_a: \mu > 41
$$

Test statistic: z = 1.084209

Critical Value: 1.644854

Rejection Region: (z \<= -1.644854, z =\> 1.644854)

p-value: 0.139136

Decision: Fail to reject H0 due to the p-value being greater than alpha and z being within the rejection region.

Conclusion: There is not enough evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that mean sunspot activity was greater than 41.

## a.

95% Confidence Interval: ( 36.15359 , 57.84641 )

## b.

z = 1.084209

Critical Value = 1.644854

p-value = 0.139136

# 3.

Test Used: Paired T-test

$$
H_0:\mu_0 - \mu_1 \le 0
$$

$$
H_a: \mu_0 - \mu_1 > 0
$$

Test statistic: t = 1.8824

Critical Value: 1.689572

Rejection Region: t \>= 1.689572

p-value: 0.03406

Decision: Reject H0 because the value of 't' is greater than the critical value and alpha is greater than the p-value.

Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean cost of living index for housing is higher than that for groceries in these metropolitan areas.

## a.

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean cost of living index for housing is higher than that for groceries in these metropolitan areas.

## b.

The mean lies within the (0.4381481, 8.117408) interval.

# 4.

## a.

Test Used: Two-sample T-test

$$
H_0:\mu_a \ge \mu_b
$$

$$
H_a:\mu_a < \mu_b
$$

Test statistic: t = -2.0059

Critical Value: -1.701131

Rejection Region: t \< -1.701131

p-value: 0.0274

Decision: Fail to reject H0, the p-value is greater than alpha, and the test statistic is not in the rejection region.

Conclusion: At the 0.05 significance level, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that field A has, on average, a lower soil water content than field B.

## b.

(âˆ’0.334, 4.178). We can be 95% confident that the true difference in mean water content is between -0.334% and 4.178%. Since this interval contains zero, this agrees with our hypothesis test conclusion that we cannot conclude there is a significant difference in mean water content between the fields.

# 5.

## a.

Test Used: Two-sample T-test

$$
H_0:\mu_d \ge \mu_s
$$

$$
H_a:\mu_d < \mu_s
$$

Test statistic: t = -2.6804

Critical Value: -2.554701

Rejection Region: t \< -2.554701

p-value: 0.007679

Decision: Reject H0 due to alpha being greater than p-value and test statistic is in the rejection region.

Conclusion: There is enough evidence to reject the claim that the mean operative time of the dynamic system is lass than with the static.

## b.

(-166.9086, 19.5276)

Since the mean difference includes 0, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the operative times of the systems at the 99% confidence level.
